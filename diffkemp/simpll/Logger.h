/**
 * Usage:
 *
 * The standard use case of this logger is using LOG(message) macro to log
 * messages to the debug output, which happens only if the debug output is
 * enabled (DEBUG_SIMPLL flag). Multiple strings or printable objects can be
 * chained within single LOG using operator '<<', for example:
 *
 *  LOG("Value: " << LeftValue << "\n").
 *
 * Each LOG automatically adds indentation to the beginning of the message,
 * determined by the current indentation level, which can be manipulated by
 * the macros LOG_INDENT() and LOG_UNINDENT(). This allows to log messages in
 * a hierarchical manner. To log messages without indentation (e.g. when adding
 * a single '\n' to the end of an already printed line), add suffix _NO_INDENT
 * to the LOG macro.
 *
 * LOG_VERBOSE and LOG_VERBOSE_EXTRA (and their _NO_INDENT variants) behave
 * analogically to LOG, but require setting a higher level of debug to print
 * their messages (DEBUG_SIMPLL_VERBOSE and DEBUG_SIMPLL_VERBOSE_EXTRA,
 * respectively; for their meaning and usage, see 'Debug levels' below).
 *
 *
 * Logging hierarchical comparisons in 'DifferentialFunctionComparator.cpp'
 * requires a special behavior for two reasons. By default, it's desirable to
 * only log the comparisons where a difference was found in it and all its
 * predecessors. Thus, logging needs to be done conditionally, based on the
 * result of the comparison. Additionally, when a comparison is finished, the
 * results of its predecessors are not yet known, and so the log of the
 * comparison must be stored until its predecessors are resolved.
 *
 * Comparison log is first prepared using macro PREP_LOG(label, left, right) at
 * the beginning of the comparison function, where 'label' is a string
 * describing the compared objects and 'left'/'right' are pointers to the
 * compared objects. This macro stores a representation of the comparison
 * message in a buffer and prepares the context for logging its children.
 * Example of usage:
 *
 *  PREP_LOG("value", L, R);
 *
 * Then, instead of calling return, RETURN_WITH_LOG(return_value) is used,
 * ending the context. The result of the comparison is used to determine whether
 * to keep the message and all its children, alternatively erasing them in the
 * case no difference was found. Example of usage:
 *
 *  if (int Res = cmpValues(CL->getArgOperand(i), CR->getArgOperand(i)))
 *      RETURN_WITH_LOG(Res);
 *
 * At the higher levels of debug, all comparisons are stored, regardless of the
 * result. For the cases where this isn't desired, a variant of this macro
 * RETURN_WITH_LOG_NEQ(return_value) can be used, ensuring keeping the message
 * only if a difference was found in it and all its predecessors, regardless of
 * the currently configured debug level.
 *
 * If RETURN_WITH_LOG (or its _NEQ variant) executed in the lowest level
 * comparison leads to keeping the logged message, it and all its stored
 * children comparison logs will be additionally automatically printed to the
 * debug output. Base indentation for each line is determined by the current
 * indentation level. Additional indentation is added to the individual messages
 * based on their heirarchy.
 *
 *
 * Debug levels (in ascending order):
 *  - DEBUG_SIMPLL logs:
 *      - module preprocessing
 *      - function comparisons
 *      - passes
 *      - relocations
 *      - pattern sets and pattern comparisons
 *      - LLVM debug information analysis
 * - DEBUG_SIMPLL_VERBOSE additionally logs:
 *      - comparisons where a difference was found
 * - DEBUG_SIMPLL_VERBOSE_EXTRA additionally logs:
 *      - comparisons where no difference was found (unless _NEQ was used)
 *      - macro processing
 *      - details about index alignment in debug information analysis
 *      - details about replacements in passes
 *      - details about dependency slicing pass
 *      - details about inverse conditions pattern
