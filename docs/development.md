## Development environment

For developing DiffKemp, you can use:

- [Nix Flake](#nix)
- Your [local environment](#local-development-environment) (installing
  dependencies directly to your system)

### Nix

We provide [Nix flakes](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes) for building and testing
DiffKemp.

First, it is necessary to [install Nix](https://nixos.org/download.html) and
enable flakes:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.config/nix
echo "experimental-features = nix-command flakes" >> ~/.config/nix/nix.conf
```

Then, building DiffKemp is as simple as running one of the following commands:

```sh
nix build                    # <- uses latest LLVM
nix build .#diffkemp-llvm14
```

This will create a new folder `result/` containing the pre-built DiffKemp which
can be then executed by:

```sh
result/bin/diffkemp ...
```

> [!TIP]
> Rather than building DiffKemp with Nix, it is better to use Nix development
> environment described below, because the DiffKemp build created by Nix has
> following drawbacks:
>
> - Currently it is not possible to run `view` subcommand (the result viewer).
> - You still need to have some dependencies installed on your system to be able
>   to use it (`clang`, `llvm`, and dependencies specific to the project you
>   want to analyse).

#### Nix as development environment

It is also possible to use Nix as a development environment:

```sh
nix develop                   # <- uses latest LLVM
nix develop .#diffkemp-llvm14
```

This will enter a development shell with all DiffKemp dependencies
pre-installed. You can then follow the [standard build
instructions](#build) to build and install DiffKemp. The only
difference is that you do not need to install the Python dependencies because
they are already preinstalled.

The generated executable is then located in `BUILD_DIR/bin/diffkemp`.

We also provide a special Nix environment for retrieving and preparing kernel
versions necessary for running [regression tests](#python-tests)
(`nix develop .#test-kernel-buildenv`).

### Local development environment

You can also develop DiffKemp directly. For this you need to install the
necessary [dependencies](installation.md#dependencies) to your system and then
you may [build DiffKemp](#build).

The generated executable is then located in `BUILD_DIR/bin/diffkemp`.

## Build

To build DiffKemp, use the following commands:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -GNinja -DBUILD_VIEWER=On
ninja -C build
```

- `-DBUILD_VIEWER=On`: This flag will install packages and build the result
  viewer. It will try to install the packages on every `cmake` run, so you may
  want to use `-DBUILD_VIEWER=Off` instead.

If you make changes to the SimpLL library, you will need to rebuild it by
running `ninja -C <BUILD_DIR>`. We are using [CFFI](https://cffi.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
for accessing the library from the Python.

To be able to use DiffKemp, it is also necessary to **install Python dependencies**,
you can install them:

- by running `pip install . && pip uninstall -y diffkemp` or
- install them manually by using `pip install <DEPENDENCIES>` (dependencies are
  specified in `packages` field in `pyproject.toml` file).

> [!NOTE]
> If you used different than the default build directory (`build`) and want to
> use `pip install .` for installing python dependencies, then you need to
> specify the build directory when running `pip` by using
> `SIMPLL_BUILD_DIR=<BUILD_DIR> pip install .`.

## Coding style

We require that the code is according to a certain coding style, which can be
checked with the following tools:

- For Python code: `flake8 diffkemp tests`.
- For C++ code: it is necessary to have `clang-format` installed and the coding
  style can be checked with `tools/check-clang-format.sh -d` (it can be also
  automatically fixed by running `tools/check-clang-format.sh -di`).
- For JavaScript code: `npm --prefix view run lint`.

## Tests

The project contains multiple tests:

- [Python tests](#python-tests),
- [Tests for SimpLL library](#tests-for-the-simpll-library),
- [Tests for the result viewer](#tests-for-the-result-viewer).

### Python tests

By default, the DiffKemp generates its own test runner executable located in
`BUILD_DIR/bin/run_pytest_tests.py`.

In addition to the standard `diffkemp` package you also have to install the
development dependencies by running:

```sh
pip instal .[dev]
```

In a case where you have installed both the `diffkemp` package and development
dependencies you can run the tests by:

```sh
pytest tests
```

There are 2 types of tests:

- Unit tests (located in `tests/unit_tests/`)
- Regression tests (located in `tests/regression/`)

The tests require the sources of the following kernel versions to be stored and
configured in `kernel/linux-{version}` directories:

- 3.10 (upstream kernel)
- 4.11 (upstream kernel)
- 3.10.0-514.el7 (CentOS 7.3 kernel)
- 3.10.0-693.el7 (CentOS 7.4 kernel)
- 3.10.0-862.el7 (CentOS 7.5 kernel)
- 3.10.0-957.el7 (CentOS 7.6 kernel)
- 4.18.0-80.el8 (RHEL 8.0 kernel)
- 4.18.0-147.el8 (RHEL 8.1 kernel)
- 4.18.0-193.el8 (RHEL 8.2 kernel)
- 4.18.0-240.el8 (RHEL 8.3 kernel)

The required configuration of each kernel can be done by running:

```sh
make prepare
make modules_prepare
```

The [rhel-kernel-get](https://github.com/viktormalik/rhel-kernel-get) script can
also be used to download and configure the aforementioned kernels.

> [!TIP]
> Since CentOS 7 kernels require a rather old GCC 7, the most convenient way to
> download the kernels is to use the prepared [Nix environment](#nix-as-development-environment)
> by running
>
> ```sh
> nix develop .#test-kernel-buildenv
> ```
>
> and using `rhel-kernel-get` inside the environment to retrieve the above
> kernels.

### Tests for the SimpLL library

Tests are located in `tests/unit_tests/simpll/` directory and they can be run
by:

```sh
ninja -C build test
```

In case the tests fail, enabling logger can simplify the debugging process.
The logger is enabled by setting the `SIMPLL_VERBOSITY` environment variable to
a number, where:

- `0`: No logging
- `1`: Minimal logging
- `2`: Moderate logging
- `3` and more: Detailed logging (the most verbose)

For example, to enable moderate logging while running tests with `ninja`, use
the following command:

```sh
SIMPLL_VERBOSITY=2 ninja -C build test
```

### Tests for the result viewer

The result viewer contains unit tests and integration tests located in
`view/src/tests/` directory and they can be run by:

```sh
npm --prefix view test -- --watchAll
npm --prefix view run cypress:run
```

## Adding a new version of LLVM to the project

Diffkemp is based on augmentation of the
[`FunctionComparator`](https://llvm.org/doxygen/classllvm_1_1FunctionComparator.html);
however, this class is not polymorphic in the upstream and because of that we
have to add it to the project manually. The steps required to do so are:

1. Extract the
   [`FunctionComparator.cpp`](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/llvm/lib/Transforms/Utils/FunctionComparator.cpp)
   and
   [`FunctionComparator.h`](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/llvm/include/llvm/Transforms/Utils/FunctionComparator.h)
   from the LLVM project monorepo, take the most recent release of your target
   major version (i.e., prefer
   [19.1.7](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases/tag/llvmorg-19.1.7)
   over
   [19.1.6](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases/tag/llvmorg-19.1.6)).
2. Create a new subdirectory at path `diffkemp/simpll/llvm-lib/<MAJOR VERSION>`,
   where `MAJOR VERSION` is the major version of the LLVM that you want to
   support.
3. Move all private methods of `FunctionComparator` to protected scope.
4. Make all methods of `FunctionComparator` and `GlobalNumberState` `virtual`.
5. Change the path to `FunctionComparator` header in the source file of
   the version that you are adding (it has to be made local, instead of
   including the LLVM one).
   ```diff
   - #include "llvm/Transforms/Utils/FunctionComparator.h"
   + #include "FunctionComparator.h"
   ```
6. Update CI (i.e., add the new version to the list
   [here](https://github.com/diffkemp/diffkemp/blob/master/.github/workflows/ci.yml)
   and change the most recent LLVM version
   [here](https://github.com/diffkemp/diffkemp/blob/master/.github/workflows/builds.yml)
   and in the [code style
   check](https://github.com/diffkemp/diffkemp/blob/master/.github/workflows/code-style.yml))
   and Nix (change the range of supported version
   [here](https://github.com/diffkemp/diffkemp/blob/master/flake.nix)) files
   with your new version. You also have to update the
   [docs](https://github.com/diffkemp/diffkemp/blob/master/docs/installation.md).
7. Make the project compilable and resolve any performance issues. However, you
   have to make sure that the source code of the whole project is working with
   all supported LLVM versions. This is usually achieved by introduction of
   preprocessor directives into the code, an example can found
   [here](https://github.com/diffkemp/diffkemp/commit/8912507d38d3a9591ee55f00a6d7524b204d0255#diff-a89268e38521e9e557604612a43cbf120ef94027230cfeea75fe24fe17f10c81R42).

## Tools for performing experiments

We have some tools which can be handy when developing DiffKemp:

- [Tool for building and subsequently comparing multiple versions of a provided
   C project](https://github.com/zacikpa/diffkemp-analysis)
- [Tool for checking semantic equality of several commits using DiffKemp](https://github.com/FrNecas/commit-analysis)
- [Tool for running DiffKemp with EqBench dataset of equivalent and
   non-equivalent program pairs](https://github.com/diffkemp/EqBench-workflow):
   You can use this tool if you make bigger changes to the SimpLL library to
   ensure that the evaluation results are not worse than before.
